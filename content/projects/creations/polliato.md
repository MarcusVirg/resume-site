Polliato is an application built to promote civic engagement, it was created in one week for a software design competition at the University of Minnesota. The application allows you to get candidate data from an election and view information about each candidate, in a ballot like format. This allows you to learn about each candidate and vote before you even get to the polling station. You can then follow certain candidates to get updates in your personal feed. The application also saves your ballot state so you can always update your votes whenever you want and it is automatically saved. The app also will let you register to vote.
To see a live version of the app go to [https://polliato.netlify.com](https://polliato.netlify.com)

> *Note:* This application is unfinished as it was implemented in a week. Do not enter any personal information when registering to vote, as we cannot guarantee that your information is secure.
